# landing-page-project

This is my first project after learning the basics of HTML and CSS from the Odin Project. I've learned how to use basic HTML tags as well basic CSS elements and most importantly, Flexbox. 

Through this project I hope to use all that I've learned in the past couple of weeks into a landing page website.

I hope you enjoy!
